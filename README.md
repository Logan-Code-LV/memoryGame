# Welcome to: The Memory Game!

**How to play...**

* Flip over any card
* Flip over a second card to match with the first card
* If the two cards match they will stay as they are
* If the two cards do not match, they will be flipped over again hiding their face value
* To win: have all cards flipped over


*You have 10 lives*
